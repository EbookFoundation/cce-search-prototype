{% block content %}
<p>This is an unofficial, experimental interface for searching records from the
US Copyright Office's <i>Catalog of Copyright Entries</i> digitized by NYPL. You
can read about the inception and progress of the project in two blog
posts: <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/03/30/unlocking-record-american-creativity">Unlocking
the Record of American Creativity—with Your Help</a>
and <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/05/31/us-copyright-history-1923-1964">https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/05/31/us-copyright-history-1923-1964</a></p>

<h2 id="reporting-errors">How to report a problem or error</h2>

<p>If the problem is with this website and not the data, for instance broken
links, server errors, or ideas for improvement, you
can <a href="https://github.com/seanredmond/cce-search-prototype/issues">submit
an issue on Github</a>.</p>

<p>If you find an error in the data please submit in issue <a href="https://github.com/NYPL/catalog_of_copyright_entries_project/issues">via the Github repository for the registrations</a> unless you are certain that problem is in a renewal entry, in which case you can submit an issue via the <a href="https://github.com/NYPL/cce-renewals/issues">renewals repository</a>. Data problems may involve simple typos, mistakes in parsing, or missing or mistaken links between registrations and renewals. When reporting data problems, please include the CCEIDs of the entries involved. The CCEID is the string of 32 letters in numbers at the end of each record, such as “be62f40e-6d17-1014-b416-88728c01eda4”.</p>

<p>If you are comfortable with git and editing large XML files, you can also submit a pull request.</p>
